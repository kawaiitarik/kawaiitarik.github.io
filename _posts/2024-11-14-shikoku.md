## Day 33 - We out here in Shikoku

Finally, I left my domesticated self behind and hit the road again. To survive the 60 km ride through Osaka’s urban jungle, I reminded myself to take every sensory input with a grain of salt. Stoplights, like a physics overlord controlling an electrical maze, dictated my pace. Countless traffic lights dotted the streets, sometimes at intersections that barely seemed to exist. Halfway through, rain began to fall. I stopped at a gas station to put on my shoe protectors. The woman running the station greeted me with a kind smile and invited me inside to meet her family. This moment of warmth was a welcome break from the cold drizzle outside.

*Very kawaii*

The day’s goal was Wakayama, where a ferry would take me to Shikoku. It also marked the beginning of the Pacific Coastal Road, which I had followed for over 600 km during the earlier part of my journey, starting a bit further up at Tanabe. I just love to connect the dots and see the beginning of what I started. 

The two-hour ferry ride flew by. Exhausted, I slept on the carpeted floors of the gender-separated lounges.  When I arrived, it was already dark, leaving my first impressions of Shikoku a mystery for the morning. Just 10 km inland, I found a free youth campground nestled along the beachfront. But, as you might have guessed by now, I wasn’t about to crawl into my sleeping bag without first steam-cleaning myself in an onsen.

Entry to another realm

This one had recently been renovated and, to my delight, was tattoo-friendly. Inside, men with yakuzaesque full-body tattoos transformed into strawberry mochis in the scorchingly hot baths. The highlight for me was the matcha tea pool. Its bright, mountain-dew-green color was intriguing at first sight but turned out to be deeply relaxing.

Then 5 km were left to the campsite, where a family was using the provided BBQ area. To not seem intimidating while appearing from out of the forest, I made myself known with a broken “Watashi wa Tarik desu.” Just minutes later, the first “Kanpai” was said, and we even lit some firecrackers.

## Day 34 - Shikoku is pure nature

As predicted, the weather forecast was right, and rain poured all night. So, I decided to sleep without my tent on the elevated wooden patio with a roof. Unfortunately, I hadn’t considered the new threat of mosquitoes, which feast on humans along the coast. While only my face poked out of the sleeping bag, and my AirPods silenced every sound, the mosquitoes devoured my face all night. I didn’t realize it until it was morning, and by then, my face was covered in bites.
![Outside sleeping]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/shikoku/outside-sleeping.jpeg)
Regardless, hearing the waves crash and smelling the salt in the air helped me shake off the discomfort and enjoy the morning dip. After 40 km, I faced an important decision: Should I head inland to save 20 km and 300 m of climbing, or stick to the coast and tackle the more difficult route? The decision was tougher than I liked. I passed the initial intersection, but in that moment, my instinct kicked in. I remembered that the fun part is going the extra mile because the rewards of empty roads and physical exhaustion are inherently desirable. So, I turned around and made one of the best decisions of my journey.

After an initial climb, I emerged through an ascending tunnel into a different universe. At 150 meters, the first untouched coastline appeared, and I was riding through the lushest bamboo-covered mountains.

*Ascended from the tunnel but hard to see between all the greens*

The sun was shining in a light haze of clouds, visible like a golden yolk in a nest of egg-white clouds. My mind entered a state of serenity, and the imagery soaked into me in a surreal, almost psychedelic way. It felt as though I had experienced this moment a thousand times, yet the next second, it felt like the first time. I think I need to drink more water.

*Shikoku's beautiul coastline*

Winding down the coast like on the back of a snake, suddenly I heard heavy rustling in the trees above me. One, two, maybe three—no, actually four— Japanese snow monkeys swung from branch to branch before disappearing into the mountains. I stood there in awe.

![ecoast2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/shikoku/eastcoast.jpeg)

Before dawn, I arrived at the village where I would stay for the night. 

![surf]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/shikoku/surf.jpeg)

At a charming 90s-era hotel, I enjoyed the onsen service and a relaxing soak in the 48°C pool, with a scenic view of the breaking waves.

*Finally, some Japanese folks enjoying the laid-back life*

Back at the campsite, with the rain pouring again, I repeated the same procedure as the night before: sleeping on a wooden patio without a tent. Maybe I’m starting to get lazy.

*Still warm enough but it would be the last night*

## Day 35 - Why Would You Leave Paradise?

![sunrise]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/shikoku/sunrise.jpeg)

This morning, I became conscious of my routine. Every day, I pack up, check my Komoot, and hit the road. After just a few minutes, I instinctively stopped and said to myself, "Ey, Tarik, why keep searching when you're already in paradise?" 

![coastline]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/shikoku/coast.jpeg)

Against my usual instincts, I retraced the road I had taken the day before and headed back to Shishikui Beach. I leaned my bike against a pole and walked down to the shoreline. Inspiration struck, and I decided to write my first haiku:

Golden sands glisten,
waves hum—thought slips with the tide.
A hawk's cry pierces.

I fell asleep, and when I woke up, surfers appeared, riding the waves. Trusting my gut, I noticed a shack just up the street. 

![pacifico]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/shikoku/shack.jpeg)

The owner had been kind the day before, giving me directions to the campsite, so I decided to check it out. He seemed about to leave when I arrived, but he greeted me warmly. He offered to hook me up with a board and wetsuit for a good deal, and how could I decline?

![boards]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/shikoku/boards.jpeg)

It was the first time I entered the Pacific on this trip, and waiting 35 days for this moment truly paid off.


## Day 36 - Struggle against the cold

All good things come in threes, they say. Maybe not for my outdoor sleeping itinerary. On my third night sleeping outside without a tent, the weather suddenly dropped to 4°C. In a 9°C sleeping bag, even with multiple layers, it was unbearable. I couldn’t sleep for more than 30 minutes straight all night. The bitterly cold wind pierced through my sleeping bag like I was a yakitori skewer. In that moment, I wished to be placed on a warm charcoal grill. The toilet house at the campsite, with its heated toilet seats, offered shelter from the cold, from deep in the night until sunrise.

![googles]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/shikoku/googles.jpeg)

With the first rays of daylight, I buckled up to cycle and keep my body warm. Despite being in such a frail state, the stunning view of the coast offered some comfort. A bit further down the coast, I was treated to a natural spectacle of the highest order. While the cold had arrived in the air, the ocean temperature remained steady. Just the day before, a half-body neoprene suit had been more than enough to keep me warm. This culminated in a jaw-dropping experience, seeing sea fog hanging onto the shore.

*Spotted before Toyo*

While I would have loved to enjoy the Shikoku east coast a bit longer, I had to push towards the next major city to gear up with down feathers. Kochi was marked on the map, so a 130km ride was in order, slowly melting the ice block that I had become along the way.

And most certainly, the first adress is the 2nd street branch to check for a new sleeping bag. Out of all the items on display, one stood out: a Montbell Alpine Down Hugger 800 with a limit of -10°C. After an initial size test on the store’s floor, I concluded that this sleeping bag should accompany me.

*Quite the steal for 27.000 yen around 160 euro*

## Day 37 - Further upgrades in Kochi

I spent the day in Kochi visiting the Montbell store, adding merino wool socks and a down feather jacket to my arsenal to combat the cold. Afterward, a relaxing visit to an onsen was in order before I transitioned to a free campsite to keep myself toasty for the night.

## Day 38 - The paths become more rugged

![morningsurf]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/shikoku/manysurfers.jpeg)
*The whole south coast around Kochi is a vibe*

The further I went down the coast, the fewer cars I encountered. Hour-long strechtes went by without a single Daihatsu roaring up the engine while overtaking, and with this as my control group exerience, I now know that driving along the highway annoys me the most. At one point, a stretch was even blocked due to landslides - supposedly. 

![block]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/shikoku/sign.jpeg)

Empiricism demands curiosity urging exploration beyond the common roads. In Japan, the line between caution and exaggeration is blurred. A pristine ten-kilometer coastal road lay abandoned, blocked not by impassable destruction but by a few scattered rocks - What a treasure!

## Day 39 - Ravishing beauty along the Shikoku's west coast

Having cycled at a steady pace along the south coast of Shikoku, today I could catch a breather as the campsite was just 60 km away. Impeccable unintentional planning yet again — as nature's beauty reached a crescendo, I could take it easy and enjoy.

*Sukumo to Ainan was a treat on the eyes*

Highlights included an elderly woman ushering me to stop during a 35 km/h descent, which I was more than curious to oblige, only to receive a rice ball snack as a resourceful energy deposit for my travels. My arigato followed undoubtedly.

And, to top it off, I managed to capture a macaque Kodak moment. 

![monkey]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/shikoku/monkey.jpeg)

Following Adam's advice, the campsite appeared just as promised on the spot with an amazing onsen on the opposite side of the streat. The course of the evening is self-explanatory by now.

*I guess the lights are kawaii...*

## Day 40 - Swinging form onsen to onsen

Finally, the nights are restful as my body gathers strength in the newly acquired Montbell cocoon. Waking up in my imago state, I plan to catch the ferry to Kyushu tomorrow and rest at yet another onsen on the land tongue before the Kyushu mainland.

![village]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/shikoku/village.jpeg)
*One of many little villages around the coast*

Unlike before, the landscapes have changed. The Ehime Prefecture boasts the optimal climate and fertile land for mandarin orange (mikan, 蜜柑) cultivation.

![mandarin]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/shikoku/mandarin.jpeg)
*The Daihatsu is the farmers best friend in Japan*

The second industry backbone seems to be the production of shirasu (しらす), very young sardines or anchovies that are dried in small villages along the coast.

![shirasu]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/shikoku/shirasu.jpeg)
*Especially delicious as a rice bowl topping*

At the onsen, true Japanese wood craftsmanship was on full display. Japanese people truly respect wood. Integrated with somewhat Scandinavian contemporary design and industrial-looking elements, it was absolutely stunning.

*Kamega Pond Hot Spring in Ikata town*

During my visit, Kono, a 68-year-old pensioner, took an increasing interest in my journey. Although we had only basic verbal communication, we surprisingly managed to understand each other quite well. After the sauna, we naturally took the cold plunge, followed by the 48°C wood-tiled bath and a salt scrub sauna. Quickly, it became self-evident that we would hang out for the rest of our stay.
