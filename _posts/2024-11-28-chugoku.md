## Day 46 - Drop Mics, Not Bombs

Entering Hiroshima today was hard to grasp. On one hand, the realization that my time in Japan was drawing to a close started to settle in. On the other hand, almost 80 years ago, one of humankind's most gruesome events occurred right at the heart of today’s destination.

Without any prior input or explanation of how, the title of this post appeared in my head, and I felt my body ignite, pushing me to give it my all on today’s route. Spurred by the classic 60/60 tail-to-headwind ratio, I was slicing through the wind regardless. I clocked my best average time today.

The finish line of today’s journey was the Atomic Dome. I just had to perform, and I self-affirmingly did. At the hostel, great conversations with the well-spoken Japanese owner followed. I truly appreciated his amazing food tips around the city and ended up going back to the same restaurant three times because the food was just that good.

## Day 47 - Museum Day

Stationary for a day, I took the opportunity to fully explore the memorial park surrounding the atomic bomb site, including a visit to the museum.
