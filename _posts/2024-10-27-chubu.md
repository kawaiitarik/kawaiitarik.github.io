## Day 13 - Ferry to Toyohashi

This night was definitely not restful. The wetness penetrated from all sides through my tent. The start of the day was around 5:00 when the first sparkles of daylight emerged. It’s never a good feeling to pack up everything completely soaked. Nevertheless, the show must go on, and after 20 km I arrived in Toba to take the ferry over a 50-minute ride for 20 euros, including the bike, to skip the urban area of Nagoya.

Arriving at the land tongue on the other side, it was 40 km of plain straight drive, which made me realize how much I miss the mountains.

There is just something to completely damaging your body ascending a mountain, with the mindset that you will break that mountain and not vice versa, over flat areas. I arrived in Toyohashi, a city where the economic bubble burst in the 90s is quite plainly visible. The city functions as the export harbor of Toyota, and all over the city are old billboards of the incumbent hardware giants like Toshiba, Panasonic, and Hitachi. 

Built up 50 years ago looking like 30 years in the future at the time, nowadays the wetlands have done their piece to them. Did I mention wetlands? That’s right; my tent is still incredibly wet, so a hotel room was the best solution in this city. The Dormy Inn was kind enough to host me and my camping gear, and the room was turned into a drying station before I could say arigato.

## Day 14 - Coasting to Shizuoka

The plans were ambitious, knowing that Komoot calculated a 119 km ride from Toyohashi to Shizuoka by going inland; I was estimating around 150 km by going along the coast. The legs felt great even with all the mileage in, and I could smell the volcanic ashes in the air sparking my desire to finally see Mount Fuji. Hence, it was a no-brainer to make some distance on these flat lands spurred by an amazing tailwind.

It should be a day with many drawbacks. Firstly, my gears started to shift in a deliberate manner. This is unsettling considering that my energy management relies on this part. Secondly, the Japanese government decided exactly now to expand on their tsunami deflection infrastructure at the cost of offering the Pacific coastal bike lane to the ocean's gods. By pushing my bike through 2 construction sites and in the act of this cutting up my finger on the gear shifter, my mood was somewhat cranky. Then, trespassing a cyclist tunnel, I almost bottle-flipped not seeing the extremely thin layer of mud and water on the ground. So the only thing that can improve the day is a bowl of ramen.

When arriving in Shizuoka, I was staying at the most lovely hostel run by two girls. I extended my stay and took a day off to explore the city and see if I could still use my legs as a means of transportation. Also managed to get my gears fixed.

## Day 15 - Shizuoka Off Day

Just cruising around town, having dinner with Mizuoka and Adam, learning about Japanese work culture. Kore kudasai is now also in my vocabulary.

## Day 16 - Finally arriving in Fuji, but where is the Mt.?

The initial ride was just 30 km, and arriving rather early at the hostel, I was greeted by Koichiro and the hostel owner. Both had cool bikes, and before I knew it, Koichiro interviewed me about my bicycle. Turned out he was a reporter for TREK bicycles and covers a wide range of cycling activities including MTB and the Japanese indoor racing team. He invited me for a rice bowl, and we had a great conversation.

*We both were intrigued it seems*

He showed me around the office, how dried fish is made, and the cup of artisan coffee is mandatory. Then I sneak peeked into Fuji, but the clouds covered the view. I hope to get more lucky tomorrow.

## Day 17 - 1000 km Milestone and Mt Fuji spotted

The day started somewhat late at 8:00 because I caught a full night's sleep, which was definitely needed to prepare for the coming itinerary. The hostel was very neat and the bed comfy for Japanese futon standards, so with a rested body and mind, the bicycle was ready in no time for take off. 

The sky was clear today, so there was no chance I couldn’t see Mt Fuji, I thought. Well, I thought right; just after passing the first bridge, there she was in all her Hokusai beauty. Of course, this year is the first time since 130 years that there is no snow on the peak due to the warm summer. It’s just the thing that makes it look iconic, but I can say first-handedly that it doesn’t take anything away from the spectacularness of this volcano. The ideal photo spot was at the heritage museum where a huge shrine gate and a water basin allowed for the ideal picture. 

![fuji]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/chubu/fuji.jpeg)

After that, the real work. There was a 55 km tour with a 1000 m ascent on the menu with a constant but steady increase in elevation. 

After an hour, a random car stopped and the driver waved at me. I rubbed my eyes; how could somebody recognize me here? But it was my friend made a day before, Koichiro, loaded with his BMX in the back and a new lawn mower who tapped my back for the coming tour. The daily goal was Lake Motosu, which is the scene depicted on the 1000 yen bill. The day went by, and this kind of ascension is nicer than the raw dogging of Koyasan. I found the campsite quickly and could take the scenic walk around the lake, spot some eagles with my binoculars. Next stop is Chino.

## Day 18 - Lake Motosu to Chino

Well, this one was mentally almost breaking me. The first 30 minutes of the morning ride ate up the 1,000 m altitude gain from the previous days like it was a Snickers. And then, I was facing 100 km with a constant gain up to 1,000 m again. Yes, almost a perfect half-pipe in the elevation profile, and especially tricky for the mind. I won’t stand here and say how great this was, because this one was another of gravity's and nature’s finest tests. Sometimes, the thought that I just had to sleep in that booked hostel in Chino was the only motivation to keep pushing.

At the time, a tropical storm bounced off the coast in Taiwan and, like a pinball, headed towards mainland Japan. It was a series of rainy days with wind speeds around 40-50 km/h. The intense rain brought cold nights, and my sleeping bag was not up to the task. Again, the hubris. I remember confidently telling the salesperson at Bever Groningen that a minimum of 9 degrees C on the sleeping bag would be more than sufficient.

Here, only some energy gels, bananas, and Pocari Sweat would do the trick. Finally, at the hostel, I was allowed entrance by sliding the door open. No Airbnb door lock code. Here in Japan, trust is a virtue. Nobody locks their sliding doors. But again, who wants to go outside when it’s raining all the time anyway?

In Chino, there isn’t much to experience. It’s a bit of a sleeping city in the mountains. So, as the sun sets early in Japan, a night walk with a restaurant visit was in order. The idea here is just to stumble into any entrance where many locals are sitting. I trust the Japanese and their palate and there are very few places the food doesn't taste good.

This led me to a diner-style restaurant, where soon a fellow visitor noticed me. He was a businessman who seemed to be a local there. He asked me about my deal, and I said, cycling. Then he asked why I came to this exact restaurant, and I told him it was because Oyaji (おやじ) was the only word I could read. He grinned, amused by my straightforward answer, and waved the server over to bring me an ice-cold Sapporo Beer. He wished me safe travels, and my arigato followed straight away.

*Kai offered a variety of Japanese Whiskies*

Back at the hostel, I met Kai and Junior, the former being the hostel owner. He wanted me to try some Japanese whiskies, which I could hardly refuse. The speakeasy with roadside access, integrated into the hostel, seemed to be his hobby.

## Day 19 - Preparation for Venus Line

The next morning, it was pouring again. On the stroll for breakfast, I stumbled upon Junior in the dining room.

![jr]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/chubu/junior.jpeg)
*Junior inviting me for lunch*

He was game to go out and offered to take me on a ride. We stopped at a rather large place, and when entering, I couldn’t believe my eyes. It was a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, with a delicately assembled network of conveyor lines carrying trays to serve sushi.

![belt]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/chubu/belt-chino.jpeg)

Scallops, sea urchin, yellowfin, and bluefin tuna. The plates kept rolling at a price of around 50 cents per piece. A beautiful orchestration of seafood-enabled lifelines at full display. 

![plates]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/chubu/plates-chino.jpeg)

Back at the hostel, it was time to pack up. An extended stay due to overbooking wasn't possible. So, I climbed again from 800 m to 1,400 m to prepare for my final ascent the next day to the Venus Line. 

![autumn]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/chubu/autumn-lake.jpeg)
*Autumn in full swing*

The hut I was staying at was about to be turned into a ski resort in two weeks when the first snow would appear. For now, it was still rain, but it would be the night that the typhoon passed. Fortunately, my immaculate timing put me in a position to enjoy the Japanese Alps after the typhoon, with warm weather during the day, around 13 degrees C.

## Day 20 - Venus Line at 1,800 m

Today, my highest altitude during the Japan trip was on the menu. Right off the gate, it was a climb from 1,400 m to 1,800 m, then go down again to 1,400 m, only to climb up to 1,800 m all over. Then enjoy a sweet descent, and before Nagano, climb two small hills again. 

![altitude]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/chubu/venus-altitude.jpeg)


The idea was solid, but the reality was different. The first two ascents went well, and I could glimpse through the clouds the top of Mt. Fuji again and wave a last farewell. When I reached the final top of the Mt. Kirigamine, I was so ready to fire downhill. 

![nature]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/chubu/venus-forest.jpeg)

![nature corner]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/chubu/venus-corner.jpeg)

![nature road]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/chubu/venus-road.jpeg)
*Views along the Venus Line*

Unfortunately, I didn’t account for Nagano prefecture road management. Having worked 3 days for this moment to fire on all cylinders and slide down this rock, porous roads effectively forced me to brake constantly. On top, the scheduled route was zoned due to landslides. Instead of going straight down, I had to opt for an 20 km detour with constant  fluctuation in altitude. 

It had to happen. An unprecdented anger rolled exactly like that landslide through every corner in my body. Every nerve and muscle was contracted until I screamed the loudest "MAAAAAAAAAAAAN EY" into the deep Venus valleys disturbing every Tanuki in a radius of 5 km from their sleep. It was the first time I was feeling desperate. Generally, being able to let the negative thoughts after bad nights of sleep, paired with rain and cold pass by as mentioned into nothingness, this time I chose to act and to scream it all out. This was quite liberating and feeling lighter I could continue. 

![wasabi]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/chubu/wasabi.jpeg)

On the way I passed by Wasabi fields in Azumino which are a joy to see growing in the river banks. Unfortunely, the spark coming from seeing the Wasabi wasnt enough to carry me through the full 140 km planned trip. At the 100km mark, the last mountain before Nagano appeard in a Ghidorah-shaped form to me and cramps of the severest magnituted lead to the decision to take the Japan Rail for the first time. Yes, I had to pull off and listen to my body. No shame in that. Upon arrival in Nagano, the ramen restaurant was just a hop across the other road side. This comfort lets all the worries of the day drown into a golden-brown, rich, creamy pool of miso goodness. 

## Day 21 - Nagano to Tokyo by Shinkansen

The initial idea to visit Nagano was to see snow monkeys relaxing in the natural springs just on the outskirts of the mountains of the city. As the summer was scorching and, for November, the daily temperature was around 7 degrees C above average, no snow was anywhere to be found. This meant that a lot of food was still up for grabs in the mountains for the monkeys, and they were not dependent on the feeding hand of mankind. Also, their desire for boiling water was not triggered in these temperatures, so no monkeys. In a spontaneous moment, I decided it would be a great idea to take the train to Tokyo while I’m somewhat in the proximity—not that it really matters with the punctual, superfast „bullet trains“. Anyhow, for approximately 80 euro, the round trip was ordered, and with 300 km/h, I was passing by the route I covered with a staggering 20 km/h, and before 10:00 am, I was in Tokyo.

![shibuya]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/chubu/shibuya.jpeg)
*Busy intersection in Tokyo*

The whole experience is mind-altering. How can the population of half of Germany live in just one city? The answer is social cohesion and impeccable planning. Upon arrival, I took the JR line in the direction of West Tokyo to Shibuya. Here, the world-famous crossing nearly sees a thousand people just every minute at the intersection. Yet, it was relatively quiet, which was the trend for the whole day. Also, no garbage was to be found anywhere. Everybody picks up after themselves, and even in this most densely populated urban area, the smells were pleasant. Without a real plan, I just took the day to get lost in the city, and as the night turned in, the city switched its coat. The bright billboards in every corner of my eye stimulated a sensory overload. It was time to leave for Nagano again.

## Day 22 - Nagano Rest

Initially, the day before was intended to provide some rest, but walking 25,000 steps in Tokyo didn’t seem to comfort my leg muscles. Hence, a day off and deep relaxation at an Onsen. This one even had a sauna.

## Day 23 - Toyama Coastal Road

After a one-day break, it was time to put some miles on the menu again. Today, around 150 km were planned, and the day started around 6:00 am. I need to stop relying on these weather forecasts; it was supposed to be sunny all day for the next few days, but reality was 7 degrees and rain. To my comfort, with declining altitude and the day marching on, the weather situation should improve.

It is always tough to start the day with a climb. The muscles are still cold, and your mind is constantly telling you why you’re not in a warm bed at this very moment, pretty much every moment.

But complaining wasn't in order since I was facing a 750 m descent over 30 km with decent roads. And with the first glimpses of sunshine through the dark clouds, my feet started to feel alive again. Leaving the Japanese Alps behind me was a great deal, since I, as a flatlander living in the Netherlands, had never been at 1,800 m altitude, let alone with a cycle. How Paulie Walnuts from The Sopranos says: "This is a big thing for me, T."

![joetsu]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/chubu/joetsu.jpeg)
*Joetsu marked the intersection between mountains and sea*

Anyhow, the ocean breeze emerged through my Buff, and the seemingly never-ending coastline lay in front of me. It is always a liberating feeling when my mountain passage of the tour blends into the coastal section. Now powered by the ocean gods on the right-hand side of me, I powered for another 70 km to sleep on a free camping site.

As I arrived, the rain started to drip on me again, so I asked kindly if I could sleep without my tent just under the hut. This was approved and probably not the best idea since the hut could only provide 2 meters of dry area. The whole night I barely slept, fearing I would get soaked while sleeping. Still better than carrying around a wet tent.


## Day 24 – A grim Outlook through Toyama

Did I mention that earlier I chose to scream rather than let my negative thoughts fade into nothingness? Today, that decision felt completely justified. I had 105 km of flat terrain ahead, passing through villages that had been affected by demographic changes. People were leaving, but the stoplights remained, as did the rain. I started counting the stoplights, but by the time I reached 100 around 1:00 p.m., I gave up. I wasn't eager to jaywalk after my Koban encounter in Owase, so I spent minutes waiting at intersections for no reason.

After a terrible night of sleep and being in a rusty harbor city like Toyama, I was frustrated. Spotting my first Tanuki made me smile, but I was still feeling drained from the past few days. It was definitely a mental low.

Kanazawa, however, was a pleasant surprise. Compared to Toyama, it was much livelier. I booked a hostel last minute, prioritizing rest to recharge. At the tourist center, I must have looked exhausted because the kind lady at the counter recommended the Onsen at the APA Hotel, located on the 15th floor with a rooftop view. It felt like every one of my complaints had a solution in Japan.

## Day 25 – Discovering Kanazawa

The previous day, my visit to the tourist center led to the purchase of tickets for a cultural display featuring flower arrangements, traditional musical instruments, and samurai choreography at night. So, I decided to take a day off in Kanazawa to explore. I visited the Kenroku-en Garden and the Museum of Contemporary Art.

In the evening, although I was the youngest among the tourists, I witnessed a harakiri performance, which was part of a samurai's final battle. It was an intense experience! Thankfully, no blood was spilled.

![samurai]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/chubu/samurai-harakiri.jpeg)

Recharged, I was now ready to head toward Kyoto and reenter the Kansai region.

## Day 26 - Last day in Chubu

Similar to the road from Toyama to Kanazawa, there was a 150 km steam ride to Tsuruga on the carte. Here, I scoped out a nice free campsite, which should give a nice view over the city. 

![tsuruga_views]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/chubu/campsite-tsuruga.jpeg)
*View over Tsuruga*

Learning from previous experience, this time I planned in advance to take the train from Echizen through the mountains, so I don’t have to encounter Ghidorah in my cycling-induced overexertion fever dreams. So on repeat, around 110 km of stoplight-infused trailblazing followed by a 20-minute breather on the train to advance on some elevation to rest for the night. Pretty straightforward. The next day, Lake Biwa, Japan's largest inland sea, was around the corner.
