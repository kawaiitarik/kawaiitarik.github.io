## Day 1 - Osaka KIX 

Turbulence was never my thing. How do you expect a great monkey to remain calm in an aluminum tin 10,000 meters above the ground? Yet, seeing the first lights on the Japanese mainland calms my nerves. Now it is only a couple of dozen minutes until I land, and I have the great opportunity to navigate myself in a new culture. Just before landing, I feel nothing, just a slight hint of anticipation in my stomach. Let's hope that Kona survived the trip as well as I did.

What hubris to think I shouldn’t worry about spare parts, the internet, maps, etc. On a basic level, everything will work; it’s the little details that still need fine-tuning. I got the cycle up to speed and managed to clock my first cheeky 30k. Overall, it’s a lovely steed. What a pleasure it is to ride through the busy yet quiet streets of Osaka.

## Day 3 - Osaka Preperations

What a day. Little update on the people I have met so far. Jeroen, the funky Vlaamse expat, is definitely the definition of a fun guy. Bartek, a Polish software developer, has a big passion for drift cars. He's the “let’s have a beer” Polish guy and helped me make progress with my blog. Jorge, a Colombian architect who lives in Stuttgart, loves Japanese shopping. According to him, you cannot be old enough for a Nintendo Switch. Happy to have had two conversations with Japanese folks. Hiro, the hostel manager, was quite cool about me blocking his hostel entrance with my bike for two nights. Mio gave me advice on Japanese soul food and vocabulary.

I finally found a pretty neat route for my travels, thanks to Erin. The Californian expat is the owner of a sweet bike rental, who tipped the scale for my route idea. The plan is to create an infinity sign through Japan, initially heading southeast along the Kumano Kudo Trail towards Mount Fuji. Then, I will avoid the Tokyo labyrinth and go straight up through the Japanese Alps. I’ll turn west again when I reach the coast to land in Kyoto, traveling north along Lake Biwa. Now back again in Kansai, I will take the ferry to Shikoku, pass through to Kyushu, and finally return over Hiroshima and the Shimanami Kaido to depart again from KIX.

Now it was time to discover more of Osaka and seriously put my Kona to the test. During my ride along the Yodogawa River, I found out that my bicycle is driving like a charm.

The only problem is my steering wheel and my saddle. Gosh, my butt hurts. I need to think about a solution to maintain buttock peace.

## Day 4 - Osaka Shopping

Rebuying a laptop in Japan is pretty cheap. I found a Lenovo ThinkPad T480s that runs immaculately. Back at the hostel, I left my vocabulary book. The hostel manager, Hiro, found the book and made fun of me for my "Watashi wa Tarik desu" entry, which is definitely a funny memory. Also, Eriko comparing me to her boyfriend, who made her a bike, was quite heartwarming. Jorge comparing sleeping hostel guests snoring to dinosaurs was pretty funny.

![Dotombori]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/dotonburi.jpeg)

I can’t wait to be on the road tomorrow.

## Day 5 - Start of the Journey

<iframe src="https://www.komoot.com/de-de/tour/1918044635/embed?share_token=aELRdwczYedPhCsOU1McQ4egL6wDdEi3u7DjVaI6Oz57UBJ1ze&profile=1" width="100%" height="700" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

What was I thinking? This must have been the most challenging task I have ever undertaken in my life. All signs were good as the grey clouds graced the skyline of Osaka, I left for Koyasan. The route was planned the day before, a 62 km tour. What could go wrong? Easy peasy. 

![Road to Koyasan]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/road-to-koyasan.jpeg)
*Almost enigmatic the first Contact with Japan's Nature*

This held true for the first 45 km, but me not understanding what climbing a mountain entails, I was in for a sincere awakening. My god, the hubris. I was really in for a reality check. I think this is what pilgrimage routes are for: one can only appreciate how nice 20 meters of straight road can be when faced with 20% inclines. This could have easily been my demise — failing on day one. Setting the tone was my intention, but gravity the teacher.

![Yumi Yano Tarik]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/school-tarik-yumi-yano.jpeg)
*Yumi and Yano hooked me up with neat juwelery*

When this elementary school appeared, I thought it was too good to be true. I was treated to specialty coffee, unbelievable hospitality, new jewelry, and a place to sleep. This was one of the best days of my life.

![Tent at School]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/school-tent.jpeg)
*The Bergans Fjell 2 isolted from the wind in the schoolyard*

## Day 6 - Koyasan 

Is this place even real? After a great night's rest and a coffee in the morning with crazy boss Yumi and Yano, my goal to reach Koyasan was clear.

![Gang]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/gang.jpeg)
*Everybody showed up for the picture*

At 10:20 in the mausoleum, an important ritual starts, which I wouldn’t want to miss in the world. Driving through the town, I wondered about every single meter how a village can be so rich in culture. The energy was high after reaching the inital goal.

![Monks]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/monks.jpeg)
*Monks of the Shingon (真言宗, Shingon-shū) Buddhism school carry a meal to the mausoleum of Kobo Daishi*

Sleeping outside is somewhat nerve-wracking, considering the outside noises and the most creepy 9 pm horror chime. What helps me is that I know that I am allowed to sleep here and nobody really saw me. Animosity crime is therefore not possible; how would they know I’m German? Also, Japanese people are the most heartwarming I have ever met. I don’t know about the authorities, but I don’t see how this should be majorly different. All that these folk care about is that the trash is picked up. As long as I do that and my newly picked up good luck charm from the shrine is working, that should be enough to get me through.

## [Day 7](https://www.komoot.com/de-de/tour/1919789811?share_token=a44DKMlb43477B6Iuh8QKA6k3mH15M3JiJfe9f1jqpywCB1Sds&ref=wtd) - Koyasan to Ryujin


![Big Shrine]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/koyasan-big-shrine.jpeg) 
*The Danjo Garan puts perspective to my bike or the other way around*

Koyasan is a place of tranquility and ravishing traditional beauty.

![Bridge]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/koyasan-bridge.jpeg)
*Entry to one of the 117 temples in Koyasan*

I find something so soothing in the forest mausoleum; couldn’t this be the most tranquil way to find your everlasting peace? (Except for all the tourists walking by every day :).

![Mausoleum]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/koyasan-forest.jpeg)
*Okunoin (奥の院) cemetery on the road to Kobo Daishi's mausoleum*

Anyhow, my legs are burning, so what’s the best thing to do? Climb from 800 to 1290m and enjoy an insane downhill ride. 

<iframe src="https://www.komoot.com/de-de/tour/1921906860/embed?share_token=amfZIjRASZbgFxqzJIlbQezUOGNQk08PFzTQgD3OX2FmMWMuUA&profile=1" width="100%" height="700" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

Occasionally, I had to fix a tire because my stupid brain couldn’t operate carefully enough to not break the air vent.

![Flat Tire]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/danke-steffi.jpeg)

At this point, thanks to Steffi, who warned me to bring a spare tire <3. Definitely always on the packing list.

![Valley]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/valley-mount-gomadan.jpeg)
*Mt. Gomadan descent at 1290 m*

I arrived around 16:00 in Ryujin, a place said to have the best onsen water in all of Japan. If this was true or a blunt marketing trick, I was about to find out. Beforehand, I checked with the roadside station if I was allowed to stay for a night. Talking to them for half an hour that I am self-sufficient, don’t think animal encounter is a realistic chance, and I really, really am fine with not having dinner, I could enjoy my first night of rest. Besides the fact that my mattress deflated every two hours. Still, luxury in my eyes. The onsen was around 4,50 euro and a towel for 50 cents that I could keep was included.

Along the river, the facility was gracing the riverbed, and I entered the separated male area. I got the gist of an onsen quite quickly. It is a place where you deep clean yourself. Ten little chairs with a bucket in front are provided with a mirror, soap, and shampoo. After that, entry to three steaming hot, either stone or wooden tiled floors was permitted. A gracious choice between 46 or 48 degree C was provided. How Anna said delightfully, the onsen turned me into a strawberry mochi. As the nights turn in early in Japan, I made my way back home and fell asleep. Now off to the coast!

## [Day 8](https://www.komoot.com/de-de/tour/1923116945?share_token=avl6sfFDV85Wz2HTIRdNESiivCZosVxge0sIP7pxL5FOyeYYep&ref=wtd) - Ryujin to Tanabe


Right off the gate, I took advantage of my altitude situation and fired downhill for the last kilometers I initially climbed during my first day trip. 

![Lawson]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/ryujin-lawson.jpeg)
*Middle of nowhere convenience store with air compressor pump*

Yes, I am leaving the mountains for the coast. My legs are scorching from the steep inclines they have never seen before. The road was relatively straightforward, therefore a lot of time to spend in Tanabe. The night before, my mattress deflated every hour or so, so I chose extravagance and luxury and have a bed in a homestay.

![Homestay]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/tanabe-stay.jpeg)
*Tanabe Homestay*

Koji was somewhat of an impatient fellow but yet very accommodating. He showed me the way to a top-notch washing salon just around the corner. These Japanese electronics are something else. In what felt to be 2400 rounds per minute, my clothes remained in pristine condition. 

![Washer]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/coin-laundromat.jpeg)
*Japan arrived in 2000 already in 1980*

Later, I took my bike yet again for a second onsen visit, just 10 km further away. This one was located just at the beach, and friendly conversations with locals were in order. After that, you guessed it, yet another onsen visit. Why not? Beforehand had some amazing ramen while I figured out Japanese ticketing systems.

![Beach]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/shirahama-beach.jpeg)
*Onsen on the coast of Shirahama Beach*

Cooked like that strawberry mochi, I made my way home and stopped along the road at the drippiest 2nd street store. The Japanese shopping experience is something else in every regard.

## [Day 9](https://www.komoot.com/de-de/tour/1924485288?share_token=aauGCgj7KPbIeqTm9kOySp4TwIBdY9pcUJZu5Eud6VWGJn1zpn&ref=wtd) - Tanabe to Nachi

That homestay bed was definitely the right call. Following the final touches, the bike was ready to grace the road once again. A 100 km journey was on the menu, but of course, I messed up the first 5 km and had to return. I can’t even blame it on Komoot. The destination was clear: Nachi Falls. Boy, oh boy, was I raw-dogging this one. I had a 1000 m elevation gain, my wrists and butt hurt tremendously, and I faced a 40 km/h headwind. This was, of course, paired with never-ending rainfall. From a bike packer's perspective, it was a free shower.

![Temple]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/daihatsu-tempel.jpeg)

But I maintained a steady pace and managed to arrive early at the temple. Here, a miscommunication occurred. Having asked the day before about the stay and the price, I understood it to be 500 yen, but upon arrival, I was told it would be 5000 yen. This was a Buddhist temple asking me for a tent and two toilet visits for 35 euros! Luckily, following the trend of this journey, Fuki, who worked at the temple, also disagreed with the steep price. She offered to take me up the mountains, introduce me to her family, provide dinner—even a bathtub—and let me set up my tent in the yard. I had never received a more intriguing invitation, so it took just 2 minutes to load the car and leave the temple in the rearview mirror.

![Leaving]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/bike-on-car.jpeg)

Without this encounter, I wouldn’t have visited the most pristine, tranquil mountain region just beside the coast.

![Waterroadside]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/water-roadside.jpeg)

She showed me the rice terraces, tea cultivation, and we had an amazing overview of the valley.

![Car trip]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/fuki-car-trip.jpeg)

Upon arriving at her house, I was treated with the utmost hospitality by her family: three young children and her husband, Kenji. They even prepared a traditional Japanese bath fueled with dried wood. 

![Bath]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/traditional-bath.jpeg)
![Helping Hand Haruki]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/haruki-fire.jpeg)
*Haruki gave a thorough explanation on the bathtub-rules*

We ate together, cracked some jokes, and went to sleep. Next trip: Nachi Falls, which the family practically lives next to ;).

![Waterfall]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/nachi-waterfall.jpeg)
*Largest uninterrupted drop in Japan at 133 m*


## [Day 10](https://www.komoot.com/de-de/tour/1925769294?share_token=aRT8Rul9R6aRIXq7TGQKb6Ti2Xp5IuggrVxB2EUSk5Zvf9hYAs&ref=wtd) - Minamihiranoku 

The most loving family hosted me for three days and essentially gave me homely comfort that I was under the surface needing a bit. Kenji is a charcoal maker, for water filtration and specialized cooking. Fuki works many jobs, at the temple, as a beekeeper, rice farmer, but first and foremost she is the engine of the family. She does it all, from cooking six different meals to talking in perfect English to me while her youngest five-year-old hangs on her; the smile on her face never left. 

![Fuki Tarik]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/fuki-tarik.jpeg)

Making okonomiyaki, grilled chicken on the shichirin, sashimi just on the fly, tried my first natto, umeboshi, and satsumaimo.

![Shichirin]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/shichirin.jpeg)
*We put Kenji's charcoal to good use*

They shared everything with me, even the traditional bathtub, which is more like a big pot, powered by cedar wood. We had sake and Sapporo, great conversations, and hopefully will see each other again.

![Schoko]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/haruki-tarik-choco.jpeg)

## [Day 11](https://www.komoot.com/de-de/tour/1927424605?share_token=aKh3AFNwbx2tp7nAsK2wdpaJfjWFje5AyQD5bujVhKErEqIQwp&ref=wtd) - Owase

Today I left my favorite Japanese family to pursue my partial goal of arriving at the bottom of Mount Fuji. Besides my smooth ride, I got pulled over by the cops for riding through a red light. They caught me red-handed, but in the end, were just curious what in God's name I was doing here in the middle of nowhere on a bike. After explaining to me a red light signal and making sure I understood, they let me go off on my merry way again.

![Surfers]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/surfers.jpeg)
*Surfers on the way to Owase*

For the comforts of laundry and drying my super wet tent, I visited a campsite with gravel areas to escape the morning dew. Let's see how the plan will turn out.



## [Day 12](https://www.komoot.com/de-de/tour/1928908227?share_token=a849xdjQ4hBurbNU4jPjOLtiqZzAY8j910MJsokFeeW22JfJUD&ref=wtd) - Ise

This was kind of the first in a series of three powerful full steam rides. The routes are not fluctuating in altitude that much anymore, so a steady pace is the aim. When I arrived in Ise, I knew beforehand where I could camp. The English guide Olivia at the road station (Michi-no-Eki, 道の駅), which are absolute Swiss army tools, elaborated on where I could spend a night for free and completely legal. After an initial check of the camping ground 6 km before Ise, I knew this night was going to be a moist one. Nevertheless, having cycled that much the previous days, a deeply relaxing onsen visit was in order.

![Onsen]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/ise-onsen.jpeg)
*Entry to the strawberry mochi cooker*

Ise can provide this for an entry fee of 400 yen. At night, back at the camping ground, dew was already settling on my skin.

## [Day 27](https://www.komoot.com/de-de/tour/1951261399?share_token=awGwXIuc66EBDCJsdPXYKLUfRWg7gE1QwxiYwOaXXBR26spdFX&ref=wtd) - Along Lake Biwa to Kyoto

After the Pacific Coastal and Japanese Alps Road, the third national cycling route of my journey lay in front of me, around 90 km around the shore of Lake Biwa (琵琶湖, Biwa-ko). Right at the start, I got ushered by an elderly Japanese man into his backyard where he proudly showed me his beautiful wooden patio. From here I could use the binoculars to spot the action on the lake. Nevertheless, not for long as there were many kilometers to schrubb.

![Shrine at Biwa]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/shrine-biwa.jpeg)

Halfway I stumbled on an anomaly, since again there was a small village clearly affected by demographic change, in the middle of nowhere, yet one house had a customer queue peeking out onto the street. Obviously, all my alarm bells went off as this could mean only one thing: Delicious food for a fair price. Not knowing what to expect, I got asked to remove my shoes and walk up the elegantly worked wooden stairs into a seating area where only a small pillow on the ground could comfort my sore butt. I could read sashimi (さしみ) in hiragana, so the pointed finger on the menu and the phrase "kore kudasai" followed.

![Party Zeit]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/party-zeit.jpeg)

Half an hour wait without knowing what to expect and then a tray full of party zeit arrived on my 30 cm high table. Everything the ocean provides was offered at a price around 13 euros, almost a Big Mac menu in the Netherlands. This provided the necessary fuel to power me through to Kyoto. I arrived at dawn and used the night for a walk to hush some glimpses of the city.

## [Day 28](https://www.komoot.com/de-de/tour/1952889994?share_token=aZFgOPDt6EnE5LhEyE3Y94xcbVvZONDCG83CiePeNKptvJ6CPe&ref=wtd)  - Return to Osaka


Since Kyoto is overrun by tourists and therefore hostels are a hot commodity, I decided to leave for Osaka straight away and connect the dots. 

![Kyoto]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/kyoto.jpeg)
*Opposed to Osaka, Kyoto has barely bright colors and rather earthy tones*

On my second day, I attempted to cycle into Kyoto to visit a bamboo forest, but I had to break off because of diminishing daylight. As a Japanese cyclist I met on the road told me, upon request for an assessment, it would be a shame not to be able to gaze at the full beauty of the bamboo. Fast forward to today, there was ample sunlight, so I was completely ready for the beauty of the bamboo.

![Bamboo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/bamboo.jpeg)
*Bamboo forest south-west of Kyoto*

Calmly, I made my way along the Yodogawa River to enter the metropolitan area of Osaka. Luckily, a night at my first hostel, The Pax, was available. (Actually, I booked the day after, but they were kind enough to lay out a futon in the common area for me). Around midday, I passed by Osaka Bicycle Rental where Erin was working on some bikes. He initially helped me lay out the route, so a friendly recap was in order before I was off to my hostel again.

![Pax]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/vin-pax.jpeg)
*Returned after 1.800 km at the starting point*

Finally, marking the first half of my journey done, I arrived at the Pax where Vin was sitting outside greeting me. It was an amazing feeling to see some familiarity again, and Eriko and Hiro were also happy to see me. At night, I met up with Adam, who was the only bikepacker I met during my travels in Shizuoka. I made good use of the British fellowman, so we went out for some beers to celebrate.

## Day 29 - Meeting Yumi and Yano Again

This day was truly special. As my journey started on Day 5, I met Yumi and Yano in the middle of nowhere as I left Osaka for Koyasan. In the mountains of the Kumano Kodo pilgrimage route, there was an elementary school hosting a coffee distillery event for the weekend. Yumi and Yano were there, and we became instant friends. 24 days later, I gave it a shot to contact Yano, as they both normally live in Osaka. He instantly replied to me, and we agreed to meet at the Shin Osaka Metro Station.

![Lunch]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/yumi-yano.jpeg)
*Okonomiyaki for lunch*

So much joy in one afternoon! We had lunch together, obviously had artisan coffee at a friend's roastery in a shopping mall. After that, we visited their little shop where they sell their T-shirt designs.

![Store]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/yano-store.jpeg)

We didn’t stop laughing. After being on the road alone for a long time, this feeling of familiarity was truly needed.

![Jokes]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/yumi-tarik-yano.jpeg)

## Day 30 - Break

From Day 30 to Day 33, I allowed myself a break to physically recharge. I'll use this time to map out my next route, maybe hit the golf range, and visit as many 2nd Street stores as possible. 


*To be continued in [Shikoku]({{ site.baseurl }}/japan/2024/shikoku#day-33)*

<a id="day-54"></a>


## Day 54 - Weihnachtsmarkt in Kobe

Arriving at my hostel in Kobe, I was just about to enjoy a fresh cup of coffee from the DeLonghi machine when another backpacker walked in. We quickly started chatting, and since we were both hungry, we decided to head out for lunch. At the restaurant, Jo showed off her impressive Japanese skills (being half-Japanese helps, apparently) and ordered some Soba dipping noodles. I parleyed the order. With the overwhelming choice of food in Japan, this was a dish I had always postponed trying. After so much time being self-sufficient, it felt nice to have someone else take charge for a change. We hit it off, and for me, tagging along with her to take the hanging cable car was a great way to ease my sentimental feelings about my time in Japan coming to an end.

![Jo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/jo.jpeg)
*Traded the bike for the cable car*

Upon arrival at the top, we stumbled upon Germany’s greatest winter cultural export: the Weihnachtsmarkt. 

![Weihnachtsmarkt]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/weihnachtsmarkt.jpeg)
*Deutschland*

This was just too funny and the last thing I would have expected to encounter on the other side of the world. We descended the 400 meters back into Kobe and found our hostel without any navigation. At night, we continued our Kobe shenanigans, eating about 50 gyozas and having a couple of pints with great conversations. Thanks for that, and I can’t wait to visit London and connect in Brixton :)

## Day 55 - The Homecoming

By now, there are two consistencies in my life in Japan. It’s my visit to the Japan Road Cycle rental to tell Erin about my travels and then go to my real home in Japan, the Pax Hostel.

![The Pax]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/Thepax.jpeg)
*My true home in Japan*

Seeing Eriko, Hiro, Kae, Vic, and all the others is a true joy I’ve looked forward to for a while. The last 30 km went by like I was stuck in a daydream, and the teacher called my name openly in class when I entered Shinsekai and saw the Hostel. My bubble burst, and I realized I was done. 3,314 km were clocked in on Komoot. Every one of them a sweaty joy. I did it, and nobody can take this from me.

## Day 56 - Old Friends

The reason why I wanted to be back in Osaka by the 8th of December was an appointment scheduled on the 12th of November. Yano and Yumi invited me to a Drip Coffee event where I could see the two of them again, and Yano had a special surprise for me.

![T-shirt]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/t-shirt.jpeg)
*Yano gifted me a shirt he designed, featuring the elementary school from my first night on the road depicted on it*

Also, Kimio, who is a menace with the drip coffee apparatus, would be there. 

![Kimio]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/Kimio.jpeg)
*Kimio, the man, the myth, the legend*

Excitedly, I made my way down south, taking 15 stations, 30 km past the airport in Osaka until I reached the final destination.

When entering the beautifully woodworked store, everybody was there who I knew from my rather foolish attempt to go up to Koyasan on day one. Literally, the people who were there for me in my moment of greatest despair were all there for me to close my adventure in a celebration of the highest form. Laughs, coffee, and true friendship.

![JP Gang]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/jpgang.jpeg)


We were beyond excitement when seeing each other again, and we took the time to make this afternoon feel like it lasted forever. I am so eternally grateful for this friendship created here and cannot wait to see you again one day.

## Day 57 to 60 - The Final Blast

Off the saddle and packed up for the journey, my legs had to do the last bits of carrying me through Osaka. By coincidence, my friend Hazel from Groningen was in town at the same time, so we had to link up and see what’s good in Osaka by night. In advance, I want to say thank you for the great time we had, and I can’t wait to treffen back in Berlin. After a stroll in Dotombori, we were both ready for a place to warm up. When she read out "Fine Reggae Bar," I wasn’t sure what exactly to expect in Osaka, but we had to check it out. 

![Good Times]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/goodtimes.jpeg)
*Entry to our living room in Japan*

Luckily, we did. As we entered through the dark black door on the second floor, the huge, beautifully worked wooden bar and Roy behind it greeted us.

![Roy and Hazel]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/royhazel.jpeg)

The next day, I needed to check Nara off my list, and by the afternoon, we met up to see God’s humble messengers and feed them crackers.

![Deer]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/deer.jpeg)
*Legend has it that 1300 years ago a god appeared on Nara's mountain riding a white deer*

![Deer Cross]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/kansai/deercross.jpeg)

The Japanese believe that the deer are responsible for communicating outerworldly needs to humans and therefore are domesticated around Nara's huge shrines. Coincidentally, it turned out that petting deer is the best hangover cure, especially when topped off with a bowl of ramen.

The last night had to be a real banger. Meeting up again for my last bowl of ramen, we kicked things off at a bar.

There, we stumbled upon two Americans and a German fellow who turned out to be great company for the evening. I was even able to tick off a karaoke night from my list.
