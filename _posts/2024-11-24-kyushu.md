## Day 41 - Melted brake pads 

The day started great. Kono came by to check on my bike, Kona, and introduced me to his dog, Kora. Now that’s what we call a triple threat in basketball terms. We had a friendly chat, and Kono gifted me a three-pack of energy booster drinks. I exchanged a piece of fruit, as gifting fruit is part of Japan's hospitality culture (omotenashi, おもてなし), and I always keep it now for trading courteous gestures. But in the end, just two buddies looking out for each other.

Upon arriving on Kyushu's soil, the squeaking of my rear brake became hard to ignore. I initially thought dirt had gotten onto the pads and rotor, but to double-check, I headed to the nearest Asahi Cycle Base. There, I was helped tremendously, and I couldn’t have been more fortunate to have lifted my ignorance at what was probably the best time.

It turned out that hardly any brake pad was left on the rear, and the front had about 20% material remaining. The right pad had worn down the most since the piston doesn’t always retract fully into the caliper. Eventually, bleeding the braking system will likely be necessary but for now the least of my worries. My calipers, unlike the usual two-piston Japanese ones, have four pistons which require differnt pads. After about an hour of calling around other branches, the friendly mechanic at Asahi lost hope. Could my brake pads be my Achilles' heel, finally my demise? I felt unsettled, but this journey has taught me to these situations with a grain of salt. So, while feeling bad about my lack of preparedness, I still thought there had to be a solution somehow.

With this diagnosis, my only choice was to ride on to Beppu, find a place to stay, and survive with the 20% front brakes. At the hostel, I scavenged the internet. My brake manufacturer, Hope, had only one licensed partner in Japan, and feeling somewhat desperate due to the outdated webshop, I sent an email asking if they had my specific brake pads in stock. I didn’t expect much but decided to give it until the next day before moving forward. Food and drinks were up next.

Just when I needed it, serendipity took over. A fellow bikepacker arrived at the hostel with the neatest setup I had seen so far. It didn’t take long for Amy to approach me as my bike appeared at the hostel entrance and Komoot was open on my desktop. She quickly connected the dots that I was also traveling by bike. We hit it off immediately and decided to head into Beppu that night. After a brief shopping excursion, we discovered a beautiful beer brewery just around the corner from the hostel.

*Not the only time we said kanpai*

For the second time on my trip, I was able to enjoy British resourcefulness in all things pint-related. We had an amazing time and even made plans to cycle the Shimanami Kaido together. I’m really looking forward to it!


## Day 43 - Grey zone operations 

The morning started somewhat blurry after last night's shenanigans. Coffee was definitely in order at Beppu train station as I accompanied Amy for her departure to Kyoto.

*I guess this is how you need to travel on the JR*

Following her advice, I planned to catch a train south to Miyazaki to spend a few days by the beach while waiting for my brake pads to arrive. After packing up my bike and buying a ticket, I made my way to the platform with quite a bit of effort, as my bike wrapped up is bulky and weighs at least 35 kilograms.

Suddenly, a conductor appeared and had closer look at my setup. He decided that my bike wasn’t compact enough for travel on the JR line. We then engaged in a Mexican standoff, as I really wanted to catch that train. Eventually, I relented and asked for a refund, which he happily agreed to.

*Sunline Beppu ticks all design boxes*

As a result, I’m now tied to Beppu at least until my brake pads arrive, hopefully tomorrow. In the meantime, I found a real gem in the Sunline Beppu Hostel and its adjacent restaurant.
